# Docker

This analysis was developed in a docker container based on the tidyverse docker image. To run the docker image run:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name AnalysisSkeleton -e USER=AnalysisSkeleton -e PASSWORD=AnalysisSkeleton seabbs/analysisskeleton
```

The rstudio client can be found on port :8787 at your local machines ip. The default username:password is AnalysisSkeleton:AnalysisSkeleton, set the user with -e USER=username, and the password with - e PASSWORD=newpasswordhere. The default is to save the analysis files into the user directory.

If you have access to the required underlying raw data then the entire analysis can be reproduced from scratch by adding the following to the `docker run` command, with the data saved into `data/analysis-skeleton`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/data/analysis-skeleton,target=/home/AnalysisSkeleton/data/analysis-skeleton
```
